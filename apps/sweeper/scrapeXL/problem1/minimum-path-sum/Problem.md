## Minimum Path Sum
Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path. Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time. Example 1: Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]] Output: 7 Explanation: Because the path 1 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 1 minimizes the sum. Example 2: Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] Output: 12 Constraints: m == grid.length n == grid[i].length 1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 200 0 &lt;= grid[i][j] &lt;= 200

#### Test case 1

Input

```
grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
```

Output

```
7
```

#### Test case 2

Input

```
grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
```

Output

```
12
```
