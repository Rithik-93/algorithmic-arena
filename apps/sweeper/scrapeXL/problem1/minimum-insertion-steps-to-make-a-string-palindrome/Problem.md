## Minimum Insertion Steps to Make a String Palindrome
Given a string s. In one step you can insert any character at any index of the string. Return the minimum number of steps to make s palindrome. A Palindrome String is one that reads the same backward as well as forward. Example 1: Input: s = &quot;zzazz&quot; Output: 0 Explanation: The string &quot;zzazz&quot; is already palindrome we do not need any insertions. Example 2: Input: s = &quot;mbadm&quot; Output: 2 Explanation: String can be &quot;mbdadbm&quot; or &quot;mdbabdm&quot;. Example 3: Input: s = &quot;leetcode&quot; Output: 5 Explanation: Inserting 5 characters the string becomes &quot;leetcodocteel&quot;. Constraints: 1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 500 s consists of lowercase English letters.
